### Hello there!!
I'm Monish. Generally speaking a Cybersecurity Enthusiast, but always curious about computers in general. Based out of Tamil Nadu, India. 

#### Looking for work:
Looking to start my career in the IT industry. I'm open to any roles in Cybersecurity, System Engineering, Reliability Engineering and Backend Software Development.  

#### Education and Certifications:
- Bachelors in Technology: Information Technology (2020 - 2024).
- [CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 Certified.](https://www.credly.com/badges/6aac3c2e-cb90-4aef-a5d2-e55af5cf5023/public_url)
- [CCNA: Introduction to Networks.](https://www.credly.com/badges/fe24ce4a-4e5b-4b76-8f98-77299b5b8948/public_url)

#### What I can do:
- Proficient in Python, Go, Bash, C/C++, Javascript, Java. Quite good with the backend stuffs, frontends on the other hand are not really my forte. Can also work with SQL and NoSQL databases.

- Know my way around operating systems. Linux, BSDs and even Windows. Have been a mainstream linux user for several years. *I use arch btw*. 

- Oh I love Networks. Have spent a fair share of time studying protocols, inspecting packets in Wireshark and socket programming. Even worked with Cisco IOS in Packettracer.  

- Good with cloud environments. So far played around with AWS and GCP only. But you know names change, but the tech is mostly the same.

- And can go on and on about tools. Familiar with operational tools like virtualization(QEMU), Containerization(Docker and Kubernetes), Configuration Management(Ansible, SaltStack) to Security tools like Firewalls, EDR/XDR, Pentesting tools (Metasploit, Burpsuite, etc...).

- Thanks to the endless CTF challenges, I can do anything from Static and Dynamic Malware Analysis, basic forensics, web exploitation, log analysis etc. Quite good with tooling around these areas as well.
